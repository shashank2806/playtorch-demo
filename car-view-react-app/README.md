# PlayTorch Starter

Open the `App.js` file to start writing some code. You can preview the changes directly on your phone or tablet by scanning the **QR code** from the [PlayTorch App](https://play.google.com) (the Expo go app will ***NOT*** work).

All projects created in Snack are publicly available, so you can easily share the link to this project via link, or embed it on a web page with the `<>` button.

If you're having problems, you can create an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/pytorch/live), tweet to us [@playtorch](https://twitter.com/playtorch), or chat with us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/sQkXTqEt33).
